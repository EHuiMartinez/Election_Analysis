This challenge required coding and updating files in github using python3 in VS Code and Terminal.  A script was created to analyze csv file data to determine the above listed outcomes.

## Challenge Summary
Module challenge included download & install of Python, Visual Studio Code and used Terminal native to Mac OS.
